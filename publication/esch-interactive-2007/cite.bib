 abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of interactively modeling large street networks. We introduce a modeling framework that uses tensor fields to guide the generation of a street graph. A user can interactively edit a street graph by either modifying the underlying tensor field or by changing the graph directly. This framework allows to combine high- and low-level modeling operations, constraints, and procedural descriptions.},
