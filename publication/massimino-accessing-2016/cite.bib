 abstract = {There is a growing interest in leveraging alternate sources of empirical data, with an increasing emphasis being placed on the Internet. This paper serves as a primer for supply chain management (SCM) researchers that may be interested in leveraging Internet-based sources for their own research, but perhaps not familiar with how to begin. Here, definitions and concepts critical to successful implementation in practice are provided. In addition, concrete, discipline-relevant examples accompany the discussion, and are aided by a fully detailed online code supplement. Performance enhancements are discussed, as well as associated caveats and limitations. Additionally, insights and guidance are offered on the unique responsibilities for researchers to uphold the ethical spirit of scientific research when continuing along these paths. Pragmatic issues related to the application of these techniques are presented for consideration of individual researchers and the SCM community as a whole.},
