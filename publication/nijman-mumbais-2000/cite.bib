 abstract = {Mumbai's real estate market was characterised by extreme volatility, extravagantly high prices and speculative market behaviour. This article examines the extent to which the market turbulence could be attributed to global capital. It finds that the players who had a decisive effect on the market were the local real estate companies, developers and the state national governments. The highly unbalanced deregulation measures allowed the demand to increase while supply was still fettered. To avoid destructive speculation in the market, inherent balance of liberalisation schemes matters most.},
