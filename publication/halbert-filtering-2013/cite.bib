 abstract = {This paper contributes to ongoing debates on the ‘landing’ or anchoring of global finance capital into the urban built environment. Inspired by recent advances from the school of Territorial Economics, it develops the concept of transcalar territorial networks (TTNs) to explain the processes that result in ‘fixing’ foreign financial capital into business properties. The paper demonstrates that TTNs contribute to filter away the risks that foreign investors associate with the complexity of local–regional property markets. It also highlights the potential consequences on the spatial, economic and social dynamics of city-regions.},
