 abstract = {Recent research has pointed to increasingly divided housing access across advanced economies. This reflects growing labor market inequality and rising intergenerational divides amplifying the importance of parental resources. At the same time, an increasing spatial polarization of housing markets has driven divergence between high-gain versus low-gain submarkets. This paper confronts how divided access to housing collides with growing spatial inequality in housing markets. The research turns to the Netherlands, drawing on full-population register data. First, GIS mapping exposes spatial polarization in house-value development. Second, household-level modeling demonstrates the impact of income, employment position and parental wealth in divided access to housing submarkets. Taken together, spatial polarization and differentiated access appear fundamental to driving inequalities in housing wealth accumulation.},
