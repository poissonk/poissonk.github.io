 abstract = {Focusing on Cape Town, this article investigates how ﬁnancialization unfolds in the South African housing market. I use a mixed method that combines in-depth ﬁeld research conducted among key market players with an analysis of georeferenced residential transactions. Connecting ﬁnancial and urban geography, the article retraces the institutional and social anatomy of ﬁnancialization. I demonstrate how ﬁnancialization unfolds in metropolitan areas through the classiﬁcation of people and the selection of spaces, by staying away from the urban poor, and instead incorporating the middle- and upperincome sections of society. In that regard, the article unpacks the urban and class structures of housing ﬁnancialization in South Africa, which challenges narratives from the urban Global North. Two market segments drive ﬁnancialization in South Africa: the rental market, which became a new ﬁnancial frontier with the emergence of corporate landlords; and the owner-occupied market, with the rise of the mortgage industry and the limited implementation of securitization, underpinned by highly restrictive lending practices. In both segments, ﬁnancial institutions and corporate landlords rely on credit scoring to classify and select tenants or mortgage beneﬁciaries; they target speciﬁc areas within the post-apartheid city to develop residential portfolios and allocate mortgages.},
