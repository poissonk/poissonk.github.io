 abstract = {Since the early sixties, western countries have experienced a further integration of office activities in their economies. The evolution of the conditions of world markets, production means and societies triggered a boom in the number of office workers. This socio-economic change federated a whole building sector and generated a real market of office buildings, mainly organised around rented and speculative property. Due to the extent of the market, suppliers provided property developments in peripheral urban areas. These evolutions modified ur- ban organisation and they challenged the economic legitimacy of inner cities, which used to be the only area concentrating office activities. Some analysts consider the deconcentration of office construction as a symbol of the decline of inner cities, seen as dying legacies of the industrial economy. Others show that it is a consequence of the most classical market processes, linked with the exaggerated tensions between supply and demand for inner cities spaces, which leads to a reinforced specialisation and economic selectivity of inner cities. Through the Parisian example, this paper aims to raise the issue of the new economic relations between centre and periphery of towns as defined by the System of office construction.},
