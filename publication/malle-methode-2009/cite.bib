 abstract = {Unlike the residential market, in office space rental hedonistic price studies are few and far between. This paper sets out to show, for the first time, the application of hedonistic prices for the office rentals in the Paris region, over the 2002-2006 period. We offer a better understand on how to fix rents according to office characteristics. The results show that the effects of size, state and location, have an impact on office rents. We also shed light on the effect on rents of the proximity to a railway station and the heavy concentration of activities near a building. However, rent fixing depends on the office location. Thus, the Paris office market is not homogeneous.},
