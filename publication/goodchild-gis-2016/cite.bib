 abstract = {Big Data can be defined by volume, velocity, and variety. Techniques for dealing with volume have a long history in geography, but velocity and variety raise new issues. A rich background of geographic knowledge will always be essential to effective use of GIS. Spatial prediction offers new and unique opportunities, while the consumerization of GIS raises many technical, social, and educational questions.},
