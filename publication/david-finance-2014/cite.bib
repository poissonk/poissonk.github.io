 abstract = {David L. and Halbert L. Finance capital, actor-network theory and the struggle over calculative agencies in the business property markets of Mexico City Metropolitan Region, Regional Studies. The selective spatialities of business property in the Mexico City Metropolitan Region are explained with reference to actor-network theory. Building on a conception of markets as the outcomes of the confrontation between different calculative agencies, the paper discusses how investment managers have to negotiate the integration of new buildings and spaces into their portfolios alongside pre-existing actor-networks whose power and autonomy differ across the metropolitan area. In a fragmented city-region, the longstanding urban coalition in the central part of the area may lock out the business property development market to finance capital while some peripheral areas may be more opened up.},
